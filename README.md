# Drawing a blank

This is the code for a blank canvas I drew.

All it does is create a `<canvas>` HTML element that covers the full viewport, and then uses the [Canvas Context 2D Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) to draw a white rectangle over the whole canvas.
